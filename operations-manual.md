## Section 1: Activities & Travel

### Annual Activities
The Web Development Club (herein referred to as WDC) will conduct the following activities:

  - Meet weekly to discuss web development and write code.
  - Market the club's web development services to other clubs, students, and faculty in order to gain development experience, give back to the community, and raise funds for the club.
  - Attend any conferences, hackathons, etc. that pertain to web development and that the members want to attend.
  - Attend ClubFest, hang flyers, and participate in other club recruitment efforts.

There are no planned events to be hosted by the WDC.

### Travel
For most activities, members will not need to travel outside campus. Should members plan to attend a conference, hackathon, etc. off campus, personal vehicles will be used.

## Section 2: Equipment & Emergency Protocols

### Hardware
The WDC does not own any hardware equipment. School computers and personal computers will be used for any web development activities. Members who use their own personal computers are responsible for ensuring the safety of their own equipment.

### Software & Online Services
No software will be purchased by the club to be installed on a personal computer. In the unlikely event the club needs special software installed on any of the school computers, WDC officers will work with the advisor, Student Activities Center, and Iowa State University's IT department to find a solution that meets the club's needs. Should the club need to purchase web-based software or services, the software will be licensed to the club and not to any individual member(s). More information about the club website can be found in Section 6.

### Emergency Protocols
No activities performed by the WDC present significant risk to personal safety. Should any activity or event be scheduled that does present safety hazards, the Risk Management Officer will take appropriate measures. The Risk Management Officer's duties are outlined in the WDC Constitution. 

**In the event of an emergency, members should first call one of the following:**

  - Ames Police Department: 911
  - ISU Police Department: 515-294-4428

Afterwards, the WDC President and Advisor should be contacted immediately and briefed of the situation. The Vice President should be contacted if the President cannot be reached. The President or Vice President should then contact the Student Activities Center to report the incident.

## Section 3: Finances & Fundraising

### Finances

#### Management
All monies belonging to the WDC shall be deposited and disbursed through a bank account established for the club at the Campus Organizations Accounting Office and/or approved institution/office (must receive authorization via Campus Organizations Accounting Office). All funds must be deposited within 48 hours after collection. The club Advisor must approve and sign expenditures before payment.

The Treasurer will prepare a budget at the beginning of each semester. The club will vote on the budget, which will pass with a simple majority vote. Changes to the budget during the semester should be presented to the club and voted upon before going into effect.

#### Outside Vendors
Should the WDC need to contract with outside vendors, the officers should consult with the club Advisor and with the Director of Student Activities prior to signing any binding contracts.

### Fundraising
The WDC will conduct fundraising by seeking sponsorship and by providing web development services to other clubs, students, and faculty. Should the club have enough funds to cover the current and projected semesterly budgets, web development services should be provided for free for the remainder of the semester. No attempt should be made to raise funds in gross excess of what is projected to be needed in the next three semesters.

#### Web Development Projects
Web development projects can be used as a source of fundraising, but the primary purpose of these projects will be to learn, grow, gain experience, and give back to the community. Fees should be reasonable and targeted at fulfilling project requirements and budget needs. It is important to ensure the client understands that this is a student club, not a professional business. As such, the client should sign a liability waiver before any work is done on a project. Any fees required for the purposes of the project (such as domain name registration or web hosting fees) should be collected at the start of the project. Any fees agreed upon for the purposes of club fundraising should be collected at the end of the project. The officers should consult with the club Advisor and with the Director of Student Activities prior to signing any binding contracts. The Treasurer should ensure all money collected by the club during the course of a project is properly handled, documented, and deposited.

#### Sponsorships
Officers should check with the Student Activities Center prior to finalizing any sponsorship agreements. All sponsorships should be listed in the document entitled "Web Development Club Sponsorships". The document should give the name of the organization, contact information, amount of the sponsorship, and any other pertinent information. Thank you letters should be sent promptly at the beginning of each semester to current WDC sponsors. The letter should express the club's gratitude for the sponsor's support, as well as a friendly update to what the club has been involved in and what it plans to do in the near future.

## Section 4: Marketing & Meeting Schedule

### Marketing

#### Recruitment Marketing
The WDC will use the following marketing strategies for club recruitment:

1. Online Media
  - Website: http://webdev.stuorg.iastate.edu/
  - Twitter: https://twitter.com/ISU_Web_Dev
  - Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ISUWebDevelopment
2. ClubFest
3. Flyers

##### Online Media
The WDC website will have various purposes and usages, one of which will be promotion of the club. An 'About Us' or 'Join' page will present information about the club for students interesting in joining. The club website is written and maintained by all members of the club, though the officers will control the merging of pull requests to the master repository. More information on website management can be found in Section 6. The Vice President will be in charge of maintaining the Twitter and Facebook accounts, though he may, at his discretion, choose to share that responsibility with other members.

##### ClubFest
The WDC will apply for a spot at Iowa State University's ClubFest during the fall and spring semesters. The table display and handouts are at the discretion of the officers or whichever member is placed in charge of the table. Ensure an application is put in for ClubFest early enough (August at the latest for the fall ClubFest) to get a spot, especially if a full table or electricity is required. Apply at the [Student Activities Center](https://www.sac.iastate.edu/sac-annual-events).

##### Flyers
Flyers will be posted at least once a semester in various buildings around campus. The main effort will be in the computer science and engineering buildings, design buildings, library, and memorial union, though flyers can be posted anywhere there may be interest. The officers are in charge of printing and hanging the flyers, though they can delegate the task to any willing members.

#### Web Development Services Marketing
*During the initial startup period of the club, there will not be a large emphasis on web development services marketing. Once the club is in a position where it wants to begin outreach and start projects for other clubs, students, and organizations, this section can be updated to reflect marketing strategies. They will most likely consist of emailing listservs, utilizing online media, handing out pamphlets to other clubs at ClubFest, and hanging flyers around campus.*

### Meeting Schedule
The WDC will meet at a time and place to be determined each semester based on the availability of club members. A meeting poll will be sent out to all members within the first few weeks to establish what time and place works best for everyone. The location will be on campus. The President or Vice President will be in charge of reserving the meeting space. The space should be reserved by submitting a [Room Reservation Request](https://www.fpm.iastate.edu/roomscheduling/student_form/). Rooms with a projector are preferable. Visit the room beforehand to make sure the projector has an HDMI input (some only have VGA). Officer meetings and meetings with the advisor will be set up by the officers at a time and place that works for everyone involved.

## Section 5: Advisor & Affiliation

### Advisor
The WDC Advisor should be an ISU faculty member who is knowledgeable in web development. The duties, responsibilities, and method of selection/replacement are listed in the WDC Constitution. The advisor does not attend club meetings regularly, but will meet with the officers at least once a month to provide feedback and guidance.

### Affiliation
The WDC has no affiliations other than Iowa State University. If the club becomes affiliated with any specific department or organization in the future, they will be listed here with a link to their website if they are external to Iowa State University.

## Section 6: Club Website

### Purpose
Since the focus of the club is web development, the club website is an integral part of operations. The general purpose of the website is as follows:

1. Provide a web development project for all members to work on collaboratively.
2. Provide a space for members to work on individual portfolios and/or try new ideas.
3. Be a source of free, public web development knowledge, in the form of blogs, tutorials, code snippets, etc.
4. Promote the club for recruitment and marketing.

### Structure
The website will generally be structured as follows (open to change):

- Home
  - About us / general information
  - Announcements
  - Upcoming events
  - Links to social media and code repository
- Knowledge Warehouse
  - Blog
  - Vlog
  - Tutorials
  - Code snippets
  - Etc
- Web Dev Services
  - General information about services provided
  - Contact information
- Member Pages
  - Each member will get a page to showcase their own individual talents and/or try out new ideas
- Join
  - Information about joining

### Management
The club website is written and maintained by all members of the club, though the officers will control the merging of pull requests to the master repository. The advisor will assist in setting up the website, make recommendations, and provide any assistance when issues arrive that the members and officers cannot solve themselves. More information on contributing to the website can be found in the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/ISU-WebDevClub/club-website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in the site repository.

### Web Hosting & Domain
The WDC's webpage will be hosted on Iowa State University's web domain (iastate.edu). Should the club decide it needs the website to be hosted elsewhere, it will work with the club advisor and with the Student Activities Center to find a solution that meets the club's needs while staying in compliance with ISU rules and regulations.

URL: http://webdev.stuorg.iastate.edu/

### Code Repository
Code written for the club will be kept in an open-source repository, such as a public GitHub repo. At no time will any of the club website code or other club-specific code be kept in a private repository. If the club is working on a project for a third party, and that party does not want the code to be public, a private repository will be set up for that specific project.
